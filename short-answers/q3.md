# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
Recursion offers several benefits, such as cleaner, more readable code and the ability to simplify complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems. This is particularly useful for recursive structures like trees, where operations such as tree traversals can be implemented elegantly. Additionally, recursive sorting algorithms leverage this approach to break down sorting tasks into smaller ones.
However, the drawbacks is that it requires more space on the call stack, which can lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth is too great. Particularly in cases like deep tree traversals or when processing large datasets. Recursion can be confusing, especially for those new to the concept. Understanding the flow of execution and tracing recursive calls can be challenging, particularly when the logic becomes complex.

# Teacher Feedback
You've correctly identified key benefits of recursion such as cleaner, more readable code, and the ability to simplify complex problems into smaller subproblems. However, the benefit of recursion for recursive structures could be more explicitly tied to examples, such as tree traversals or recursive sorting algorithms, to strengthen the explanation.

You mention that recursion can be confusing, which is a valid point, especially for those new to the concept or when dealing with complex recursive logic. A bit more detail on why recursion can be confusing—such as the difficulty in tracing recursive calls and understanding the flow of execution—would provide a more complete picture.
