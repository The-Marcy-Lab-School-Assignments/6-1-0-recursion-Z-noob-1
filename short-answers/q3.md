# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
The benefits is that it's a cleaner code and more readable. Simplifies complex problem into smaller subproblems. Good for recursive structures. The drawbacks it takes more space on callback stack and run the risk of stack over flow. Can be confusing at times.

# Teacher Feedback
You've correctly identified key benefits of recursion such as cleaner, more readable code, and the ability to simplify complex problems into smaller subproblems. However, the benefit of recursion for recursive structures could be more explicitly tied to examples, such as tree traversals or recursive sorting algorithms, to strengthen the explanation.

You mention that recursion can be confusing, which is a valid point, especially for those new to the concept or when dealing with complex recursive logic. A bit more detail on why recursion can be confusing—such as the difficulty in tracing recursive calls and understanding the flow of execution—would provide a more complete picture.
