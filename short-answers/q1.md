# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
Recursion is a function that calls upon itself until it hits base condition. The two cases are base case and recursive case. The base case is essential because it defines the condition that terminates the recursion, preventing infinite loops and stack overflow. The recursive case is where the function invokes itself with a changed input.


# Teacher Feedback
You've given a succinct definition of recursion as a function that calls itself until a base condition is met. However, the term "base condition" might be more accurately referred to as "base case" to align with common terminology in computer science.

You correctly identify the two primary components of recursive functions: the base case and the recursive case. However, you can expand a bit more on how each case contributes to solving the problem. The base case is critical as it provides the condition under which the recursion stops, preventing infinite loops and stack overflow. The recursive case is where the function calls itself with a modified input.
