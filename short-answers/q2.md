# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
To search through a big problem that need to be broken down. A tree traversal or a linked list. So data structure that's recursive or naturally recursive. On problem that iterative.

# Teacher Feedback
You mention tree traversal and linked lists, which are excellent examples of data structures that are naturally suited to recursive solutions due to their hierarchical or nested structures. However, the phrasing "On problem that iterative" seems incomplete or unclear. Can you expand on this and add clarity.

Your response could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how recursion works with these data structures and why its the better choice. You can dive into explaining why recursion is suitable for these types of problemsâ€”such as how recursion simplifies the code by not requiring explicit stacks or other auxiliary data structures. 

Lastly, your response can be strengthened by clarifying why recursion is particularly effective for these types of problems.
