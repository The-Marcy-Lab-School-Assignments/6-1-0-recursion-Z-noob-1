# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
To search through a big problem that need to be broken down, data structures like trees and linked lists are ideal because they are inherently recursive. In a tree, each node can have child nodes, which allows for clear recursive traversal—starting at the root, you can visit the left subtree, then the right. This natural structure makes the code easier to read. Recursion also simplifies implementation by managing state automatically, eliminating the need for explicit stacks or loops. Similarly, linked lists, where each node points to the next, enable straightforward recursive navigation. While iterative solutions can be more memory-efficient, they often lead to more complex code, especially for hierarchical structures. Overall, recursion is effective for trees and linked lists because it matches their structure, simplifies code, and improves readability.

# Teacher Feedback
You mention tree traversal and linked lists, which are excellent examples of data structures that are naturally suited to recursive solutions due to their hierarchical or nested structures. However, the phrasing "On problem that iterative" seems incomplete or unclear. Can you expand on this and add clarity.

Your response could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how recursion works with these data structures and why its the better choice. You can dive into explaining why recursion is suitable for these types of problems—such as how recursion simplifies the code by not requiring explicit stacks or other auxiliary data structures. 

Lastly, your response can be strengthened by clarifying why recursion is particularly effective for these types of problems.
